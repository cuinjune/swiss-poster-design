# Swiss Poster Design
This is the week 2 assignemnt for the ITP class Dynamic Web Development.

[Live Demo on Glitch](https://cuinjune-swiss-poster-design.glitch.me)


## Inspiration
I chose the following poster since I find it simple, balanced, and has an organized grid system.

## Design

I started with drawing a sketch by hand to determine how the contents should be placed.

And then I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bKlUfptNqNW3dEMznKsARr/Kinderspel?node-id=0%3A1) to create wireframe, visual design, and style guide.
